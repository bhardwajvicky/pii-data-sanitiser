# Thread Safety Improvements for CheckpointService

## Problem
When processing large databases with parallel threads, the checkpoint file writing was causing conflicts because multiple threads tried to modify the same checkpoint file simultaneously. This led to:
- Corrupted JSON files
- Lost checkpoint data
- Application crashes

## Solution
The `CheckpointService` has been made thread-safe with the following improvements:

### 1. File-Level Synchronization
- Added a static `SemaphoreSlim _fileLock` to ensure only one thread can access checkpoint files at a time
- All file operations (read, write, delete) are now synchronized

### 2. Atomic Write Operations
- Changed from direct `File.WriteAllTextAsync()` to atomic write operations
- Uses temporary file + atomic move to prevent file corruption
- Process: Write to `.tmp` file → Delete original → Move temp to original

### 3. Proper Exception Handling
- All file operations are wrapped in try-finally blocks
- Ensures the lock is always released, even if exceptions occur

## Code Changes

### CheckpointService.cs
```csharp
// Added static lock for file-level synchronization
private static readonly SemaphoreSlim _fileLock = new SemaphoreSlim(1, 1);

// Atomic write operation in SaveCheckpointAsync
var tempPath = checkpointPath + ".tmp";
await File.WriteAllTextAsync(tempPath, json);
if (File.Exists(checkpointPath))
{
    File.Delete(checkpointPath);
}
File.Move(tempPath, checkpointPath);
```

### ObfuscationEngine.cs
- Removed redundant `_checkpointLock` since `CheckpointService` now handles its own thread safety
- Simplified checkpoint update code in `ProcessBatchAsync`

## Testing Thread Safety

### Manual Test
1. Run the application with a large database and high parallel thread count
2. Monitor the `checkpoints/` directory for file corruption
3. Verify checkpoint files remain valid JSON after parallel processing

### Automated Test (Future Enhancement)
```csharp
[Test]
public async Task CheckpointService_ConcurrentWrites_ShouldNotCorruptFile()
{
    var service = new CheckpointService(mockLogger);
    var tasks = new List<Task>();
    
    // Create multiple concurrent write operations
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        tasks.Add(Task.Run(async () =>
        {
            var state = new CheckpointState { ConfigHash = "test", Status = "InProgress" };
            await service.SaveCheckpointAsync(state);
        }));
    }
    
    await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
    
    // Verify file is still valid JSON
    var loaded = await service.LoadCheckpointAsync("test");
    Assert.IsNotNull(loaded);
}
```

## Performance Impact
- Minimal performance impact due to short lock duration
- Lock is only held during file I/O operations
- Parallel processing of data obfuscation continues unaffected
- Checkpoint updates are infrequent (once per batch completion)

## Benefits
1. **Reliability**: No more corrupted checkpoint files
2. **Resume Capability**: Checkpoints can be reliably resumed after interruptions
3. **Scalability**: Supports high parallel thread counts without conflicts
4. **Data Integrity**: Atomic operations prevent partial writes
